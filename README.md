# TFBS-Analysis-For-Multiome-Data
The objective of this pipeline is to identify putative TF regulatory mechanisms focused on differentially accessible genes and differentially accessible chromatin obtained from single cell multiome analysis, with scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.

Adapted to obtain gene coordinates from gencode.v41.annotation.gtf which can be downloaded here: https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_41/gencode.v41.annotation.gtf.gz
